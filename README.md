# MarketPlace

This project was made during my Android course in university and this project's scope was to create a Market Place Android application, which communicates with an API. The API was created by 3SS from Targu Mures, so the backend part of the project was given and we just had to make the frontend part of the application.

This application was made in Android Studio with Kotlin language and it can be run via Emulator or on your phone by installing it with Android Studio or with any other program.
